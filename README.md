# KotlinReference

This repository follows all the reference that kotlin.org has to offer and aims
to be a one stop learning point for all the kotlin reference.

I have planned to keep it updated throughout as long as i can keep it updated.

All the lessons are inside modules similar to the structure at kotlin reference 
on its reference website.
